          <b> African Violet:</b> African Violets are one of the most popular
          plants for indoor gardens. Most species naturally live in the
          mountains, usually under the cover of other plants. Because of this,
          they require moderate temperatures and light, which can easily be
          found and controlled inside of homes. However, some indoor gardeners
          shy away from growing them because their care can be intimidating.
          These plants come in almost every color and have a frilly or fringed
          texture to the petals. They will bloom nearly every day if in bright
          and dependable lighting. The foliage is typically green or variegated,
          with a slight fuzz in texture.
